# Federate Learning Personalization
This repository will contain the implementation of some of the parameter decoupling Federated Learning personalization algorithms using the Flower Framework <https://flower.dev/>. The implemented algorithms were studied in the use case of OutSystems to predict the next node in action flows. The results of the study were submitted to the "International Workshop on Federated Learning: Recent Advances and New Challenges in Conjunction with NeurIPS 2022 (FL-NeurIPS'22)" workshop.
